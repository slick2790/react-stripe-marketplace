# Vercel 404 Error Fix Guide

## Issue
Getting 404 errors when accessing direct URLs on Vercel deployment.

## Root Cause
React Router uses client-side routing, but Vercel tries to serve files from server. When you visit `/marketplace` directly, Vercel looks for a `/marketplace` file that doesn't exist.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated vercel.json
- Added proper rewrites configuration
- Set build environment variables
- Added cache headers

### 2. Added _redirects file
- Fallback for all routes to index.html
- Ensures SPA routing works properly

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push these changes to your repository**
2. **Redeploy on Vercel** (automatic if connected to Git)
3. **Clear browser cache** and test routes

## Test Routes
After deployment, test these URLs directly:
- `your-domain.vercel.app/marketplace`
- `your-domain.vercel.app/products` 
- `your-domain.vercel.app/dashboard`

## If Still Getting 404s

1. **Check Vercel Build Logs**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Functions tab
   - Look for build errors

2. **Manual Redeploy**
   - In Vercel Dashboard, go to Deployments
   - Click "..." on latest deployment → Redeploy

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all required env vars are set in Vercel Dashboard
   - Check Settings → Environment Variables

## Alternative Fix
If issues persist, try changing from BrowserRouter to HashRouter temporarily:

```tsx
// In App.tsx
import { HashRouter } from "react-router-dom";

// Change BrowserRouter to HashRouter
<HashRouter>
  <Routes>...</Routes>
</HashRouter>
```

This will make URLs look like `domain.com/#/marketplace` but guarantees routing works.
